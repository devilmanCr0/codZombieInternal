# COD Zombies Internal
An internal trainer for the original Black Ops Zombies. A simple project to help me learn more about virtual memory and game cheats!
# Compilation
Compiles as a DLL, which you would use to inject into Black Ops, provided that you already have 
an injector.

# Features
- God Mode
- Rapid fire       
- (broken)ESP
- Aimbot
- Money

#Todo
- Fix that broken ESP! One of the features of this trainer is to outline the zombies
as they move around the map, but that's currently broken haha :P
